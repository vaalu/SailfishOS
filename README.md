> I tried to create a simple news reading app for native sailfish os based on MER platform.
> I have not covered any tutorial or how to for sailfish os porting. This is just a simple
> My initial idea is to just create a simple RSS file reader, which I can use it for readidng news feeds from various sources.
But there are licencing and obligations, coz of which I just left it to the user, so that I will just provide a platform to read a news feeds.
> Hence, I have tried covering the following:
* List all of the news feed channels.
  * Add / Remove / Edit news feed channel.
  * Name of the rss channel needs to be provided.
  * URL of the rss channel needs to be provided.
  * After accepting the rss feed channel: 
    * The corresponding RSS Feed will be added to the local device storage
    * Using the device's own SQLite storage.
